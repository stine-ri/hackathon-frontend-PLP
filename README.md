## 🧠 Features

### 🎓 Education & Practice
- ✅ **AI Quiz** — topic-based quizzes in MERN, Flutter, Dart, AI, and Software Testing  
- ✅ **Mock Interviews** — personalized sessions with scoring and motivational feedback  
- ✅ **Progress Tracker** — see streaks, skills mastered, and learning history  

### 🚀 Career Growth
- ✅ **Resume Builder** — clean, exportable resume based on user skills/goals  
- ✅ **Windsurf AI Coach** — smart topic-based learning recommendations via Windsurf API  
- ✅ **AI Recommendations** — based on career goals + quiz/interview results  

### 🔒 Auth & Persistence
- ✅ JWT-based login/register  
- ✅ State saved across sessions (MongoDB + LocalStorage)  

### 💬 Optional Enhancements
- ✅ Integrated Chatbot via Chatbase  
- ✅ Feedback Engine with answer comparison  
- ✅ Admin-ready quiz backend structure  

## 🤖 Smart AI Integration (Windsurf)

SkillSync uses **Windsurf**, an AI developer tool, to deliver personalized recommendations based on the user’s chosen learning path.

### 🧠 How It Works:
- When a user selects a topic (e.g., **MERN**, **Flutter**, **Software Testing**),
- A **dynamic controller** sends that topic to the Windsurf API.
- Windsurf returns curated recommendations including:
  - Learning paths  
  - Project ideas  
  - Tool suggestions  
  - Tips for interviews or productivity  
- The frontend displays this as a **personalized “AI Coach” section**, giving users real-time guidance to grow faster.

📌 This creates an **intelligent learning experience** that feels truly **personal and career-focused**.
